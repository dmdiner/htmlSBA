There are a couple of pages, from the drop down you can see there are THREE featured cats, with their age and instagram links in a table for ease of access.
There is a page with a gallery of each feature, and the images enlarge when you hover over them.

There is a user form to submit some feedback from radio buttons and email/submit button with a modal popup after submission. 

There is a final page with a rock paper scissors game (Sherman, Winky, Jinx) named after the featured guests, and an alert will show if you won, or lost against the random number generated computer. There is also an MP4 that can be modified/manipulated by buttons on the screen, with a secret MP4 aswell!
